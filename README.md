# Convex Hull

This project is created for the first semester of master's degree subject 'Computational geometry'.

It is written in C# and uses WPF for graphical UI.

The aim of the project is to allow comparison between different convex hull algorithms and measure the time of their execution. 

It is possible to choose or randomise the vertices and view the visualisation of the results.
